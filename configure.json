        "about_text" : "I am Tejo Vardhan Kattamuri and I am currently pursuing my bachelor's in computer sci and AI at the Amrita School of Computing, amritapuri. I originally hail from Vishakapatnam, but being from the defense family I have moved and stayed in different parts of India, and this I feel makes me both flexible and adaptable. As evidenced by my bachelor's degree, I specialize in the domains of healthcare AI and explainable AI, and recently my team and I published a paper on the same, and this makes me capable of working as a student research intern at the Amrita Center for Wireless Networks and applications where we work on creating techniques where AI can help solve problems in the domain of healthcare.",
